I am a postdoctoral fellow at Genentech, advised by [Mark McCarthy](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/mark-mccarthy) and [Aviv Regev](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/aviv-regev). My research interests are broadly in using statistical genetics and systems biology to understand the basis of human traits and diseases. 

I received a Ph.D in [Biomedical Informatics](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html) from Stanford University, where I worked with [Jonathan Pritchard](https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/home.html). My thesis on modeling genetic and experimental perturbations to gene regulatory networks was funded by the National Library of Medicine and a [Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/people/). Earlier, I was a research data analyst with [Manuel Rivas](https://med.stanford.edu/rivaslab.html) and [James Priest](https://priestlab.stanford.edu/), performing genetic epidemiology studies in population-scale biobanks. Outside the lab, I enjoy hiking around the Bay Area and solving puzzles (especially crosswords!).
